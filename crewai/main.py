"""CrewAI + xProof: 3-agent crew with on-chain certification.

Each agent's task output is certified with 4W metadata:
  WHO  = agent role (researcher, writer, reviewer)
  WHAT = SHA-256 hash of the output
  WHEN = UTC timestamp
  WHY  = task description

Install:
    pip install xproof crewai

Run:
    python main.py

Production usage — attach XProofCrewCallback to your crew's lifecycle hooks,
or give agents the XProofCertifyTool to certify on-demand.
