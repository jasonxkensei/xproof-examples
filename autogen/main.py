"""AutoGen + xProof: certify every message exchanged between agents.

Each send and receive is certified with 4W metadata:
  WHO  = agent name (sender or receiver)
  WHAT = SHA-256 hash of the message
  WHEN = UTC timestamp
  WHY  = "message_sent" or "message_received"

Install:
    pip install xproof pyautogen

Run:
    python main.py

Production usage:
    from autogen import ConversableAgent
    from xproof import XProofClient
    from xproof.integrations.autogen import register_xproof_hooks

    client = XProofClient(api_key="pm_...")
    alice = ConversableAgent(name="alice", ...)
    bob   = ConversableAgent(name="bob", ...)

    register_xproof_hooks(alice, client=client, agent_name="alice")
    register_xproof_hooks(bob,   client=client, agent_name="bob")

    alice.initiate_chat(bob, message="Summarise the Q3 earnings report.")
